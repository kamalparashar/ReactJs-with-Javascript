onClick wants function as its parameter. But setColor needs value thereby executing function and onClick gets a value instead of a function as parameter.
If we directly give setColor('red') (which is the syntax to set color to the variable else it will not work), this setColor will give him value which onClick() didnot want.
So, giving a arrow function to onclick() and inside this arrow function we call setColor to set the background color.
